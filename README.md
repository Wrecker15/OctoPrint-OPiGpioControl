# OctoPrint OPi GPIO Control

GPIO Control adds a sidebar with on/off buttons. You can add as many buttons as you want that will control each device connected to your Orange Pi.

Very useful if you want to add some electronic/improvements to your printer.

- type name for your device connected to GPIO
- type pin number according to BCM numeration - for more details please [visit this page](https://pinout.xyz/)
- select if device is driven for low or high state of GPIO
    - _active high_ means that device is **on for high state** of GPIO and **off for low state**
    - _active low_ means that device is **on for low state** of GPIO and **off for high state**
- select if device should be on or off by default eg. after startup
